# OHW21_proj_tag_data
Optimize a tool for making environmental data (ocean velocity, SST) in an easy-to-use format for ecological research (I.e. make mapped data easier to load into R, format data with recognizable variables that are measured by GPS tags)

Several papers have demonstrated links between large marine animals and mesoscale eddies as they present foraging opportunities in the open ocean. Examples include:

A significant gap in many ecologists' toolkits is being able to connect animal tracking data to ocean processes easily and to visualize this combined data.
